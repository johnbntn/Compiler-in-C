# Notes
These are going to be notes of features I want to add to Little C.
## Things I Want to Add
- Types
- Pointers
- Arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- If/Else logic
- Structs
- Potential to make system calls
- File extentions (.lilc)

### Libraries
Once I have a fully functioning language, I want to add a shared library system. Specifically, I want to add libraries for the following:
- Memory management (malloc, free)
- Basic mark and sweep garbage collection
