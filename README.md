# Compiler-in-C

I'll be making a compiler using C that will compile a simple programming language.
Compilers can be thought of as 3 directives:
1. Lexical Analysis (lexer)
2. Parsing (parser)
3. Assembling (assembler)

As of right now, I have created a basic lexer that recognizes arithmetic operators +,-,*,/ and integers.

##Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis is the process of breaking down code into segments called tokens, allowing the computer to process them. Telling the computer what tokens mean allows it to process them.

'testing'
