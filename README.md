# Compiler-in-C

I'll be making a compiler using C that will compile a simple programming language that I'll be calling Little C.
Compilers can be thought of as 4 directives:
1. Lexical Analysis (lexer)
2. Parsing (parser)
3. Assembling (assembler)

## Usage
For more information on the language, refer to the [documentation](Docs/)
